					We are FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition (FRC) Team Rambots 4571 from East
					Harlem, New York. FIRST Robotics Competition is an international high
					school robotics competition that allows teams to design, program, and
					build a robot starting with a common set of rules to play in a themed
					head-to-head challenge. Teams also build a brand, develop community
					partnerships for support, and work to promote STEM in their local
					community.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are a diverse team of Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics
					students. We have students from a variety of socioeconomic
					backgrounds, many of whom require financial support. As a New York
					City Department of Education public high school, our funding is
					limited to the amount given for that given year.
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, we would love to have your help to assist us in our journey
					as a sponsor. Rambots has won a total of 12 awards in our career
					including the Regional Finalist award twice and the Gracious
					Professionalism Award 5 times. Rambots has reached the FIRST World
					Championships 3 times.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are many options to help support our team. We accept monetary
					donations of any amount. We also accept food to supply to our
					students.
